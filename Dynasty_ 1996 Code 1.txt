This, paired with general malaise, has produced a Republican ticket nobody but one man wanted.</br><br>Across the aisle, the Democratic Party experienced an almighty scramble in the primaries. Emerging from this battle is Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. Long considered a strong potential candidate, it would seem the party is ready to give liberalism one final attempt after four consecutive losses on the presidential level. Cuomo's first challenge is to unite his party, and given the polling, that should be the only challenge, even despite rumblings of another Ross Perot candidacy this fall.</br>",

During his time in Albany, he has declined the opportunity to run for president twice before, first in 1988 and again in 1992, despite draft movements for his candidacy. Now, it would seem that Cuomo is finally prepared to shed his \"Hamlet on the Hudson\" moniker, and given his opponent, he's practically got a free ticket to the White House.</br><br>Touting his record as governor and popularity among the party base, Cuomo dispatched most of his primary opponents with ease. There is some concern that his liberalism will be a detriment in Southern states that went for Clinton four years ago, and further concern regarding stances such as his staunch opposition to capital punishment, which may prove unpopular in the high-crime environment. However, with the unpopularity of Quayle and the potential for Ross Perot to enter the race, nearly every state seems to be in play for the Cuomo campaign this fall. So long as no serious scandals or gaffes occur, Cuomo seems set to become the first Italian-American president.</br>",

You can take solace in knowing that at least Congress is still majority Democratic, so it's not as though Quayle will be able to pass much of his agenda. Your term as Governor of New York expires in 1998, and while there's nothing saying you can't run for yet another term, it's probably in your best interest if you return to the private sector.

Choate doesn't have the perceived slow-wittedness that Stockdale was believed to have, but neither does he have the grandeur befitting a decorated war hero that Stockdale possessed. For what it's worth, Choate is at least more competent in expressing his positions, as a prolific author.</br><br>Should Perot be able to qualify for the debates again, Choate would be able to perform more competently in the vice presidential debate (for those who watch it), and his economic stances could help draw in conservatives.",

That is, of course, unless Cuomo tacks a bit too far to the right for his liberal base to be comfortable with. It's an impossibility for him to win a state given the lack of Green Party resources and the bulk of third party votes likely going to Perot, but in siphoning progressives away from Cuomo, America may be given yet another Republican presidency. Regardless of how this years' run goes for Nader, one thing is for certain, he'll be back in four years. And eight. And twelve. Hell, why not sixteen or twenty? Any publicity is good publicity these days.",
